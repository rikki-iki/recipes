# Sarma (cabbage rolls)

## Ingredients

* Jasmine rice (unwashed) 8 tbsp per kilo
* 2 onions finely diced
* Bacon (good quality, smoked) thickly sliced
* Saurkraut 
* 1kg pork mince
* 1kg beef mince
* 2 whole pickled cabbage heads
* 1 tsp sweet paprika
* 2 tsp salt (to taste)
* 2 tsp vegeta (to taste)
* 2 tsp pepper (to taste)
* 2 eggs
* 4 tbsp tomato paste

## Method

Fry onions on high. Add mince and brown. Add paprika fry until all water is gone. Turn heat down and mix through rice. Check for seasoning then turn heat off and add eggs and mix through.

Assemble Sarma (cut stem our of a cabbage leaf, place 2-3 tbs of mince in the middle and roll tightly, tucking the ends in so it's sealed) and pack into deep pot, layered with the bacon and Saurkraut.

Cover the top with spare cabbage leaf and a plate to weigh it down. Pour in one mug of water mixed with tomato paste and salt. Bring to boil over high heat then simmer until the cabbage is soft - about an hour.
