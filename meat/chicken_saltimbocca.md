# Chicken Saltimbocca

## Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs
* 4-6 sage leaves
* 4 slices of prosciutto
* Olive oil
* 20g good butter
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup white wine
* 1 bunch parsley (chopped)

## Method

Trim the thigh and flatten with the flat side of a meat mallet to even thickness. 

Season thighs and place 1-2 sage leaves (depending on size) on each and top with a slice of prosciutto (removing 
any than overhangs the meat). Flatten again gently to press the prosciutto into the meat.

Add olive oil and butter to a pan and heat up until butter starts to brown. Fry the meat with the prosciutto side down
first until just golden. Turn over and fry for a few more minutes until chicken is cooked. Remove and rest.

Add wine to the pan and some more butter if needed, and simmer for a minute or two. Pour over the chicken and sprinkle
with the chopped parsley.
