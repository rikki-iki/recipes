# Fish croquettes

## Ingredients

* 300g of swordfish
* 300g of desalinated salt cod
* 1/3 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 2 eggs, beaten with a fork
* 1/2 cup of water
* 1/2 cup of beer
* 2 cups of self-rising flour
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 1/4 teaspoon of pepper

## Method

Remove skin and bones from the fish and cut into small pieces.

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients to make a thick mixture.

Bring oil to medium heat in a deep fryer or a deep skillet or frying pan (use plenty of oil). Drop mixture by the heaping tablespoonful in the oil and fry until golden on all sides. Drain in a colander.

Note: Have a bowl of cold water at hand. After each spoonful, dip the spoon in cold water before taking the next spoonful.
