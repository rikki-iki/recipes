# White wine sauce

## Ingredients

* 1L fish stock
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 1 tbsp butter
* Salt and white pepper, to taste
* Lemon juice, to taste

## Method

In a saucepan, gently heat the cream to just below a simmer, but don't let it boil. Cover and keep warm.

In a separate saucepan, simmer the wine until it has reduced by half.

Add the fish stock to the wine, bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and reduce for about 5 minutes or until the total volume has reduced by about a cup.

Stir the warm cream into the fish stock and bring it back to a simmer for just a moment.

Stir in the butter, season to taste with salt and white pepper and just a dash of lemon juice.
