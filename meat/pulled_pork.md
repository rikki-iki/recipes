# Pulled pork

## Ingredients

* 1.5kg pork shoulder
* 2 sticks cinnamon
* 3 bay leaves
* 2 brown onions
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp chilli powder
* 1 tbsp ground cumin
* 1 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1 bottle of good bbq sauce
* 2L bottle coke

## Method

### 24 hours before meal…

In a large bowl combine sugar, chilli, cumin and cayenne and rub all over the pork until it’s completely covered. 

Add bay leaves, cinnamon and onion (cut into quarter chunks). Cover and leave in the fridge overnight.

### 9 hours before meal...

Move to slow cooker and cover with coke. 

Cover with lid and let cook for 8 hours. 

If the coke doesn’t entirely over the pork you might need to turn it over halfway through.

### 1 hour before meal…

Remove meat from slow cooker and let cool a little. 

Pull apart with fork into chunks. 

Add a little of the coke mix to moisten then add BBQ to taste (as much or as little as you like).
