# Steak

## Ingredients

* Scotch fillet (2cm thick) - 1 per person
* Sea salt flakes
* Cracked pepper
* Extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tsp minced Garlic (minced)
* 50g Danish salted butter
* 2-3 sprigs of thyme

## Method

Leave steaks out of fridge for 1 hour, to adapt to room temperature 

Season steaks with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic paste

Add extra virgin olive oil, button and thyme spigs to pan

Heat pan on max until hot and butter has slightly browned

Cook 2 mins a side (medium), 1:30 minute side (medium rare). Only turn the steak once - don't fiddle with it.

Let sit for 10 mins before serving - you can make [gravy](https://github.com/rikki-iki/recipes/blob/master/sauce/mushroom_gravy.md) in this time :)
