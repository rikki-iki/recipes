# Sarma (incomplete)

## Ingredients

* 500g Pork and veal mince
* 1 jar of sauerkraut
* Rice
* Get the ingredients from Marin's mum

## Method

In a pot, put Â½ a large jar of sauerkraut then place the sarma sitting up around the edges of the pot, making your way to the centre of the pot as it gets fuller.

Add the remaining sauerkraut on top and cover with water. 

Add a can of chopped tomatoes (or 1 tablespoon of tomato paste) and cook.

The sarma is finished when it feels soft as you poke it with a fork.
