# Olive oil pasta

## Ingredients

* 2 shallots
* 4 garlic cloves
* 4 anchovies
* 1 tsp rock salt
* 1 tsp mixed herbs (fresh or dry)
* 1 tsp chilli flakes
* 1 tsp ground coriander seeds
* 1 tsp vegeta
* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
* Pepper to taste
* Bacon
* Broccollini
* Green beans
* Cherry tomatoes
* Pasta of choice

## Method

In a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic, shallots and anchovies with the rock salt to a paste then add the herbs, vegeta, chilli flakes, pepper and ground coriander. 

Whilst mixing add the olive oil and vinegar so it emulsifies into a thick sauce.

Put your pasta on to boil and in a fry pan start to fry the bacon. 

Once it starts to brown add the broccolini, green beans and cherry tomatoes then add your sauce. 

Cook, stirring regularly until the beans soften. Add some pasta water towards the end to moisten. 

Turn off the heat, drain and stir through your pasta.

Serve with good parmesan cheese grated on top.
