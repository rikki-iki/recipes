# Fishy risotto 

## Ingredients

* 1 fillet white fish
* Handful of pippies
* 1 cup Arborio rice
* 500ml fish stock
* 500ml vegetable stock
* 150ml white wine
* 3 anchovies 
* 6 capers
* 1 onion
* 4 garlic gloves
* Salt and peppers 
* Juice 2 lemons 
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Mushrooms 
* Cherry tomatoes 
* Celery
* Butter
* Parmesan cheese
* Parsley

## Method

In a separate pot, warm through the stock and keep it on a low heat so it stays warm.

In a mortan and pestle finely mash garlic, capers and anchovies with salt and pepper into a paste with olive oil.
Dice onion and cook until softened. Add wine, anchovy paste and mix through to deglaze pot. 
Finely dice the celery and add to the pot.
Add rice and stir through so the grains are coated.
Cook rice, stirring regulary until the grain start to whiten.

Ladel one spoon of stock into the rice and stir until it's mostly absorbed. Add two or three more ladels of stock, one at a time, waiting until each is absorbed.

Cut the mushrooms into cubes and the cherry tomatoes in half. Cut the fish into bite sized chunks.
When the rice is about two thirds cooked, add the mushrooms, tomatoes and fish and stir through.

Continue ladelling in stock until the rice is al dente. The amount of stock needed varies, and if you run out use boiled water instead.

Once rice is mostly cooked, add pippies and let them open. Then turn off the heat and stir through parmesan cheese, butter and roughly chopped parsely.
