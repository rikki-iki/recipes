# Honey Dijon Lamb cutlets

## Ingredients

* ¼ cup of olive oil
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
* 6-7 lamb cutlets
* 1 tablespoon of rosemary
* 1 tablespoon of honey
* 3 tablespoons of Dijon mustard
* ⅓ cup beef or vegetable stock

## Method

Combine olive oil, rosemary, garlic, honey, lemon juice and Dijon mustard, salt and pepper to taste in a bowl and mix together well.

Coat the lamb cutlets and marinate for 10 minutes.

Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat.

Add drained lamb cutlets, reserving the marinade and cook for 3 minutes on each side. When done, remove the cutlets from the frying pan and keep warm.

Stir the stock into the same frying pan, scraping any sediment from the bottom. Stir in the remaining marinade, bring to the boil and stir until slightly thickened.

This dish is best served with a salad.
