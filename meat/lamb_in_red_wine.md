# Lamb in red wine (slow cooker)

## Ingredients

* Lamb leg or shoulder 
* 4 sprigs rosemary
* 1 whole garlic
* 1 truss of Roma tomatoes
* 1 cup red wine
* 1/2 cup water

## Method

Salt and pepper the lamb and brown on all sides in olive oil.

Cut garlic in half and arrange in slow cooker with remaining ingredients. Place lamb on top and cook on low for 8 hours.

Once finished, remove the lamb and pull appart into chunks. 

Remove the tomato truss (but not the tomatoes) and rosemary sticks from the slow cooker. Push the garlic out of the skin 
and discard the skin. Gently smoosh the garlic and tomatoes into the liquid. 

Turn the slow cooker onto a browning setting and add dust over 2 tablespoons of flour. Mix into the remaining liquid to 
make a gravy. Return the lamb to the gravy and stir through before serving.

Best served with [mashed potato](https://github.com/rikki-iki/recipes/blob/master/sides/potato_mash.md) and sauteed broccolini.
