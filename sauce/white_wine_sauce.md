# White wine sauce

## Ingredients

* 1 quart fish velouté
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 1 Tbsp butter
* Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste
* Lemon juice, to taste

## Method

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, gently heat the heavy cream to just below a simmer, but don't let it boil. Cover and keep warm.

In a separate saucepan, simmer the wine until it has reduced by half.

Add the velouté to the wine, bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and reduce for about 5 minutes or until the total volume has reduced by about a cup.

Stir the warm cream into the velouté and bring it back to a simmer for just a moment.

Stir in the butter, season to taste with Kosher salt and white pepper and just a dash of lemon juice. Strain through cheesecloth and serve right away.

Makes about 1 quart of White Wine Sauce.
