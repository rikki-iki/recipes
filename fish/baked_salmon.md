# Baked Salmon

## Ingredients

* Salmon fillets (boneless)
* 1 to 2 lemons sliced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Butter
* Extra virgin olive oil

## Method

Cut alfoil into 30cm sheets (1 for each piece of salmon). Pour a small amount of olive oil in the middle of each sheet.

Place salmon over oil and season, place 1-2 slices of lemon on top, and a nob of button on each. 

Collect the foil up and fold over the edges to seal it tight, but leaving space inside for steam to gather. 

Bake on 250 for 15 minutes.

Serve with [sauteed greens](https://github.com/rikki-iki/recipes/blob/master/sides/sauteed_greens.md)
