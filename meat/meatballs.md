## Meatballs

# Ingredients

* 1 onion
* 5 cloves garlic
* Handful grated parmesan cheese (cheap cheese if fine)
* 1 tbs chilli flakes
* 1 tbs mixed herbs
* Parsley
* 1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp of ground pepper
* 500g pork and veal mince
* 3 slices white bread in milk
* 1 bottle passata
* Optional bacon (lol)

## Method

### 5 hours before meal...

In a small bowl, soak the bread in some milk.

Finely slice the onion, garlic and parsley. Add to a large bowl along with the mince, salt, pepper, chilli flakes, mixed herbs, parmesan cheese, Worcestershire, eggs.

Squeeze the milk out of the bread and pull the bread apart into small pieces and add to mince mix.

Mix the mince together really well so it’s all evenly combined.

Roll the mix out into palm sized balls and place evenly spaced on a tray. 

Leave the meatballs in the fridge for at least 2 hours to set, if not overnight.

### 2 hours before meal…

Preheat oven to 250c.

Pour the passata into a baking dish (with chopped bacon if desired). 

In a fry pan, brown each meatball before arranging them into the sauce so they are evenly spaces. 

Spoon some sauce onto the top of each meatball if they aren’t covered.

Bake for 2 hours then cover with grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.
